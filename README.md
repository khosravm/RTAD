**Real Time Anomaly Detection**

Real-Time Anomaly Detection is a project that demonstrates the implementation of real-time anomaly detection using TensorFlow for modeling and PySpark for stream processing. This project showcases how to monitor and identify anomalies in streaming data from various sources.

**Introduction**

Anomaly detection is a critical task in various domains such as cybersecurity, industrial equipment monitoring, and financial fraud detection. This project demonstrates how to implement real-time anomaly detection using TensorFlow's autoencoders for modeling and PySpark's Structured Streaming module for processing streaming data.

**Features**

- Utilizes TensorFlow for anomaly detection modeling.
- Employs PySpark's Structured Streaming for real-time data processing.
- Handles streaming data from various sources.
- Detects anomalies based on model predictions

**Getting Started**

Prerequisites:
- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow
- PySpark
- Kafka (for Kafka integration, if applicable)

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/khosravm/RTAD.git
cd RTAD 
```
2. Install the required packages:
   
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Usage**
1. Configure the necessary parameters in the code, such as model hyperparameters, Kafka broker details (if using Kafka), etc.
2. Run the provided scripts to start the anomaly detection process:

`python real_time_anomaly_detection.py`

Customize the script according to your needs.

3. Observe the real-time anomaly detection results printed in the console.

**Configuration**
Modify this file to customize the behavior of the anomaly detection system.
